# Mike's Golang Notes
This is pre-release version of an E-Book entitled Mike's Golang Notes. 

This book provides information and sample source code for those learning or using the Go Programming Language.

To view this e-book you will need an e-book viewer. Popular options for a free e-book viewer include [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html) and [Calibre E-book Manager](http://calibre-ebook.com/). 

Since this e-book was developed with the Calibre system, the Calibre E-Book Manager will provide a superior viewing experience. Plus, the Calibre viewer has the advantage of a 'back button' and 'forward button'.  Otherwise, the Adobe viewer is perfectly suitable for viewing this e-book.

For best results, I recommend using the '.epub' format. However, a '.pdf' file is also provided.
