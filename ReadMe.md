# Mike's Golang Notes
This is pre-release version of an E-Book entitled Mike's Golang Notes. 

This book provides information and sample source code for those learning or using the Go Programming Language.

To view this e-book you will need an e-book viewer. Popular options for a free e-book viewer include [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html) and [Calibre E-book Manager](http://calibre-ebook.com/). 

Since this e-book was developed with the Calibre system, the Calibre E-book Manager will provide a superior viewing experience. Plus, the Calibre viewer has the advantage of a 'back button' and 'forward button'.  Otherwise, the Adobe viewer is perfectly suitable for viewing this e-book.

  ##Known Issues
  
  2016-12-01 - Received Reports that epub document not loading under linux.
  
  2016-12-05 - Re: linux issues. Personally loaded .epub file under a clean installation of Ubuntu 16.04 and Calibre E-book manager. Seems to function as planned. Presentation looks great. Calibre linux installation is discussed [here](http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux).
  I used recommended Calibre installation command:
  ```
  sudo -v && wget -nv -O- https://download.calibre-ebook.com/linux-installer.py | sudo python -c "import sys; main=lambda:sys.stderr.write('Download failed\n'); exec(sys.stdin.read()); main()"
  ```
 Please let me know if you experience difficulties.
